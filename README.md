### README: Risk Management Ontology

#### Introduction
This Risk Management Ontology is designed to model the various elements involved in managing risks within an organization. It represents different types of risks, threats, vulnerabilities, impacts, controls, incidents, and their interrelations. This structured approach helps in identifying, assessing, and managing risks systematically.

#### Classes and Subclasses
The ontology consists of 60 classes and subclasses, organized hierarchically into key areas relevant to risk management:
